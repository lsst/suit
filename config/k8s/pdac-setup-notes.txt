SUIT on PDAC Kubernetes
updated on 5/19/2019 to reflect changes needed to setup portal/app deployment on 'k8s commons'

kubectl is available to designated user on lsst-lsp-int and lsst-lsp-stable

To ensure portal nodes are reserved for portal's pods:
add taint to portal nodes
$ kubectl taint nodes lsst-portal-tomcat01 dedicated=portal:NoSchedule
$ kubectl taint nodes lsst-portal-tomcat02 dedicated=portal:NoSchedule
$ kubectl taint nodes lsst-portal-tomcat03  dedicated=portal:NoSchedule

To designate 1 node for 'int' environment and 2 nodes for 'stable' environment

add label environment=portal-int to node reserved for 'int' env
$ kubectl label node lsst-portal-tomcat03  environment=portal-int

add label environment=portal-stable to node reserved for 'stable' env
$ kubectl label node lsst-portal-tomcat01 environment=portal-stable
$ kubectl label node lsst-portal-tomcat02 environment=portal-stable

NOTE: multiple firefly pods required a 'shared' directory on its host.
As is, tomcat01-2 has a filesystem mounted at /sui/firefly/workarea for this purpose

from suit-pdac-setup.yaml:
- create namespace ‘portal’ for portal related pod, svc, ing
- create suit-secret for tomcat admin user


yaml files are located in config/k8s/ on GitHub: https://github.com/lsst/suit
suit-int.yaml is for the 'int' environment
suit-stable.yaml: is for the 'stable' environment
They are mostly the same with only a few differences.  In the future, we may want to
further customize each one to better fit its usage/environment.


Below is specific to the 'int' environment.  But, it's similar for 'stable' as well.
from suit-int.yaml:

add tolerations block to allow this pod to run on portal nodes
    spec:
    ...
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "portal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

add nodeSelector block to select portal node reserved for 'int'
change this to portal-stable when deploying on 'stable' env
    spec:
    ...
      nodeSelector:
        environment: portal-int

add securityContext block to run as suiadmin
    spec:
    ...
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 101
        fsGroup: 101


point 'FIREFLY_SHARED_WORK_DIR' and 'SERVER_CONFIG_DIR' to /sui/firefly/{workarea,config} on the host filesystem using ‘hostPath’.
      volumes:
      - name: firefly-workarea
        hostPath:
          path: /sui/firefly/workarea
          type: Directory
      - name: firefly-config
        hostPath:
          path: /sui/firefly/config
          type: Directory


deploy suit as https://lsst-lsp-int.ncsa.illinois.edu/portal/app/
- 2 pods from ipac/suit:lsst-dev
- each with 24GB of memory
